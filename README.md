# Malignant-Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis
A Keras-based Neural Network which predicts whether a breast cancer tumour is malignant or benign.

# Summary
A Neural Network built with Keras consisting of two hidden layers. ReLU and Sigmoid activation are used.
The model is trained and validated using a data set (n = 569) from Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database; data collected by by Dr. William H. Goldberg, W. Nick Street and Olvi L. Mangasarian at the University of Wisconsin. The data consists of 30 features calculated from digitized images of Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA) of breast mass. The data is thoroughly described in the links below.
